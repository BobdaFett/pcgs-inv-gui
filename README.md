# pcgs-inv-gui
A very simple application to search for and keep track of a collector's coin inventory through the use of CSV files and the Public PCGS API.
This is very much WIP.

It will be written with Python using PySide6 Qt (with QtWidgets)
External pull requests are welcome! If you see something that really bugs you and you think you can do it better, send it over, I'll take a look at it.

When this application releases, I will not be able to provide OneDrive or Google Drive API functionality. Unfortunately, due to the way that Python is interpreted,
I would have to release the entire application along with the API keys that provide authentication. This would be a breach of contract against PCGS, Microsoft, and
Google. Therefore, it is not possible, however you're welcome to use your own PCGS Public API key.
